    "# About this example-qual-analysis-1 notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple example of an automated AI workflow, designed to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or a local environment. It uses [the ai-workflows package](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/ai-workflows) to summarize and perform some basic qualitative analysis on a set of documents. The documents might contain interview transcripts, customer service tickets, or any other text-based data. The notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt you to upload or select a `.zip` file with the documents to summarize and analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract the text from each document\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Summarize each document\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Identify the top 10 themes present in the documents\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Code each document with the themes identified\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Output the results in a series of `.csv` files\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the ai-workflows GitHub repo](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/ai-workflows) for more details on the `ai_workflows` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires different settings depending on which AI service providers you want to use. If you're running in Google Colab, you configure these settings as \"secrets\"; just click the key icon in the left sidebar (and, once you create a secret, be sure to click the toggle to give the notebook access to the secret). If you're running this notebook in a different environment, you can set these settings in a `.env` file; the first time you run, it will write out a template `.env` file for you to fill in and direct you to its location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the settings, regardless of the environment.\n",

    "### OpenAI (direct)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `openai_api_key` - your OpenAI API key (get one from [the OpenAI API key page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and be sure to fund your platform account with at least $5 to allow GPT-4o model access)\n",
    "* `openai_model` (optional) - the model to use (defaults to `gpt-4o`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI (via Microsoft Azure)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI via Microsoft Azure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `azure_api_key` - your Azure API key\n",
    "* `azure_api_base` - the base URL for the Azure API\n",
    "* `azure_api_engine` - the engine to use (a.k.a. the \"deployment\")\n",
    "* `azure_api_version` - the API version to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anthropic (direct)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Anthropic directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `anthropic_api_key` - your Anthropic API key\n",
    "* `anthropic_model` - the model to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith (for tracing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can add [LangSmith tracing](https://langchain.com/langsmith):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `langsmith_api_key` - your LangSmith API key\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will prompt you to select or upload a `.zip` file. It should contain all the documents you would like to summarize and analyze.\n",
