Not only was 2023 the hottest year on record by a stretch, but each month from June onwards was the warmest from that month ever recorded. Moreover, every day was 1\\u00b0C or more warmer than the pre-industrial norm for that day and the world came perilously close to the 1.5\\u00b0C limit it is seeking not to overshoot.\\n\\nNot to sound like a broken record, but what these broken records illustrate is that the heat is on to tackle the climate crisis rapidly and robustly. And Carbon Market Watch was there, along with allies in the environmental movement, demanding action, exposing inaction and formulating feasible, science-based paths forward.\\n\\nSo how is the world doing?\\n\\nLast year\\u2019s record was a mixed one. Encouragingly, the European Union managed to wind up its mammoth \\u2018Fit for 55\\u2019 package of measures and regulations aimed at slashing 55% off its net carbon footprint by 2030. However, the proof of the pudding was in the testing, and many of the compromise measures proved not to go far enough or to be too unambitious or riddled with loopholes to make a difference.\\n\\nAt the global level, the situation was patchier still. COP28 ended up with no significant new commitments to reduce emissions, though some progress was made on climate finance for developing countries. However, when it came to Article 6 carbon markets, there was deadlock - but this failure avoided a worse outcome.\\n\\nBeyond governments, we also kept an eye on the corporate world and the voluntary carbon market. We not only exposed greenwashing but also scored significant successes in combating outrageous climate claims. We saw self-regulatory initiatives of the voluntary carbon market take important strides towards bringing more integrity to the trade in carbon credits. This change in direction was in part due to the pivotal role of civil society and the media in highlighting the shortcomings of the existing system and exposing foul play where it occurred. Some members of the old \\u2018VCM guard\\u2019 left their posts.\\n\\nThroughout these processes, CMW played its dual role as watchdog and research institute: we analysed the proposals on the table, provided policy recommendations, opposed bad choices and supported good ones. We know how to \\u2018growl\\u2019 at problems but are just as ready to \\u2018wag our tail\\u2019 when we see solutions.\\n\\nIn this annual report, we\\u2019ve compiled the highlights of 2023 and the successes we achieved. We could not have accomplished this without the talent, passion and dedication of our staff. Our team has thrived through its daily cooperation. We have sweated together on fundraising applications and reports, but also on a city cycling tour and a summer dance in the park. We encourage each other to make the best use of our strengths and to honour our convictions in our day-to-day lives. We have been buoyed by the unwavering support of our honorary board, members, funders and allies.\\n\\n**Sabine Frank**\\n\\n**Executive director**\"\n",

Another project from Portugal is an animal sanctuary that helps teach birds to fly again. In addition, ETS funds are supporting a just transition for coal regions in Greece by training up youth and promoting renewable energy.\\n\\nThe videos we produced also highlight many of the EU ETS\\u2019s failings and shortcomings. Foremost among these are the plethora of pollution permits handed out to heavy industry absolutely free of charge. These freebies deprive national treasuries of desperately needed funds to finance the clean energy transformation, bankroll innovation in decarbonisation, and safeguard a just transition that leaves nobody behind.\"\n",

However, the source of income is also found to exert independent effects. In this case the source is debt relief, which features a positive marginal effect but also a countervailing negative effect, perhaps due to stigma.

      "      \"content\": \"Average relief amounted to over Rs.17,000, roughly half the annual consumption expenditure of the average rural household.\\n\\nTwo features of this program made it particularly well suited to analysis. First, for most beneficiaries qualification was based upon a sharp landholding cut-off. Farmers owning land below a certain threshold received 100% relief, while farmers above that threshold qualified for only 25% relief. This allows me to estimate the causal effect of 100% relief by treating it as a natural experiment and using the landholding cut-off in a regression discontinuity design. Second, the 25% relief was contingent upon repayment of the remaining 75% balance. Because a large majority of 25%-relief beneficiaries in fact repaid their remaining balances, this allows me to infer a lower-bound valuation for full relief in terms of present-value wealth. Otherwise, it might have been difficult to value relief, as the value to beneficiaries could have been substantially less than face value.\\n\\nThe key outcomes I consider are self-reported happiness and life satisfaction \\u2013 collectively known as subjective well-being (SWB) \\u2013 measured roughly 18 months post-relief. I follow a growing number of economists in considering these SWB measures as broad indicators of experienced well-being (see, e.g., discussions and reviews in Frey and Stutzer, 2002; Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2006; Loewenstein and Ubel, 2008; Fleurbaey, 2009). While there has been a substantial body of empirical work on the income-SWB relationship (e.g., Easterlin, 1974; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008), it has tended to be correlational in nature. My use of micro data from a natural experiment allows for a more focused consideration of the causal relationship.\\n\\nEstimation of the income-SWB relationship proceeds here in three steps: (1) estimating the causal effect of debt relief on happiness and life satisfaction; (2) deriving conservative upper and lower bounds for the value of that relief in terms of present-value wealth and then annual income; and (3) estimating the effect of income on SWB with an instrumental variables approach, using debt relief as an instrument for post-relief income.\\n\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The following section provides additional background on both the related literature and the debt relief program in question.\"\n",

Wealth and well-being\\n\\nBecause the income-well-being relationship sits squarely at the crossroads of choice- and experience-based measures of welfare, it is situated within the broader debate over how to best assess welfare. In this context, K\\u0151szegi and Rabin (2008) lay out the basic case against welfare inferences drawn exclusively from choice behavior. Their conclusion that \\u201cchoice behavior alone can never reveal which situations make people better off, even with unlimited data and under the maintained hypothesis of 100% rational choice\\u201d rests heavily on the fact that individuals\\u2019 preferences are choice-set-dependent (also called menu-dependent). Along the same lines, an earlier and more thorough theoretical critique can be found in Sen (1977). Relaxing the assumption of rationality only strengthens the argument.\\n\\nK\\u0151szegi and Rabin suggest, however, that choice is in fact a sufficient basis for welfare inference under certain \\u201cancillary assumptions\\u201d that are likely to hold in many contexts. The trick is figuring out when these assumptions do or do not hold. When necessary, they suggest complementing choice-based measures with alternative approaches to the measurement of well-being, such as the measurement of happiness. They take, in fact, happiness or well-being to be the ultimate aim of public policy (p. 1824), but this is by no means an uncontested notion. Sen (2009) and Nussbaum (2008), for example, level a variety of conceptual objections. Fleurbaey (2009), Stiglitz et al. (2009), Thinley (2007), and Diener and Seligman (2004) discuss the issue from the perspective of replacing or complementing GDP as an indicator of social welfare or economic progress. Broader reviews of the \\u201chappiness economics\\u201d literature include Frey and Stutzer (2002), Di Tella and MacCulloch (2006), and Graham (2005).\\n\\nThough much work has focused on happiness, the related psychological literature on subjective well-being (SWB) has long posited two distinct dimensions (e.g., Diener, 1984; Diener et al., 1999). One dimension, most closely associated with self-report measures of happiness, is primarily hedonic in nature; it is variously associated with \\u201cpositive affect\\u201d or \\u201cemotional well-being.\\u201d Another, most closely associated with self-report measures of life satisfaction, is more cognitive in nature; it is variously associated with \\u201cjudgment\\u201d or \\u201cevaluation.\\u201d In this paper I call these dimensions, simply, happiness and life satisfaction.\"\n",

      "      \"content\": \"The relationship between income and SWB has been of particular interest within the economics literature. Most modern inquiry into the subject responds to or follows from Easterlin (1974). Easterlin suggested that richer countries were no happier than poorer countries, even though richer individuals were happier than poorer ones within any given country. This stylized fact has come to be known as \\u201cthe Easterlin paradox\\u201d (but not without challenge, as in Veenhoven and Hagerty, 2006; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008). The United States has been an important case in point, where richer individuals have tended to report being happier than poorer ones, but tremendous post-war growth in per-capita income has not been matched by a corresponding rise in average happiness.\\n\\nThere is a vast and growing body of empirical work on the subject. Most scholars follow Easterlin in considering cross-section or panel data, as in Di Tella and MacCulloch (2008), Layard et al. (2008), Hagerty and Veenhoven (2003), and Stutzer (2004). These studies tend to establish correlation, however, rather than causation. After all, one can tell many plausible stories for why both income level and income growth would be endogenous. Some, though, have come considerably closer to causal estimates. For example, Gardner and Oswald (2007) use longitudinal data for UK lottery winners to establish a positive income-SWB relationship.\\n\\nStevenson and Wolfers (2008) re-evaluate the Easterlin paradox by considering a wide range of data and methods. They present a variety of evidence against Easterlin\\u2019s findings, summarizing the income-SWB relationship with a single meta-estimate of 0.4. They present their estimate as broadly consistent across both within- and across-country analyses, find no evidence of a \\u201csatiation point\\u201d beyond which SWB no longer rises with income, and suggest that the relationship is similar for both happiness and life satisfaction (once these measures are standardized to a common scale). This pits their findings against a host of earlier studies, a fact that they confront in their discussion. The latest analysis by Kahneman and Deaton (2010), for example, finds important differences between happiness and satisfaction measures: the former feature satiation at a certain income level, while the latter do not.\\n\\nThe present analysis brings micro-level evidence to bear, using a natural experiment to\"\n",

Debt relief\\n\\nIndia\\u2019s 2008 Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief program was partly motivated by a highly visible increase in farmer suicides, most notably in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, where high indebtedness among farmers was an oft-cited factor. The economic theory of *debt overhang* (Ghosh et al., 2000) may have also provided motivation, with the expectation being that lower indebtedness would increase the efficiency of investment across the agricultural sector. As a sizable transfer to over 36 million farmers before national elections, the program may have also served other political purposes. Because it reimbursed banks and cooperatives for bad loans, the program was also popular with these lenders, and may have helped to revive financially troubled institutions.\\n\\nThe program considered formal agricultural debt issued by cooperative, commercial, and rural banks. This included crop loans, investment credits for direct agricultural purposes, investment credits for purposes allied to agriculture (e.g., dairy), and agricultural debt restructured under prior debt restructuring programs. Debt to moneylenders, relatives, and other informal lenders, as well as any loans taken for non-agricultural purposes, was not included in the program.\\n\\nTo qualify for relief, a loan had to be overdue or restructured as of December 31, 2007 (well prior to the program announcement). The amount of relief depended on the location and classification of the borrower, with farmers qualifying for either a full 100% waiver or a more limited 25% relief conditional on repayment of the remaining 75%. As shown in Table 1, \\u201csmall and marginal farmers\\u201d received a full waiver, while \\u201cother farmers\\u201d received the conditional 25% relief. In drought-prone and other specially-designated districts, the partial relief was 25% or Rs. 20,000, whichever was greater.\\n\\nFarmer classification depended on the type of loan.

Empirical strategy\\n\\nI employ a regression discontinuity (RD) design to identify the effect of debt relief and an instrumental variables approach to identify the effect of income more generally. I define the sample frame and relevant discontinuity using administrative data from participating rural banks, then use household survey data to assess outcomes. Finally, I use official land records to audit the accuracy of bank-reported landholdings.\\n\\n### 2.1. Data\\n\\nThe analysis focuses on a particular population of farmers in rural India. These are farmers who (a) lived in a particular geographical area (the central-northwest part of Gujarat, a state in Western India); (b) held formal agricultural loans with one of the leading banks serving the area; (c) had total landholdings within a certain range; (d) held loans for which these landholdings were determinant of debt relief qualification; and (e) were overdue on their loan payments as of the end of 2007, therefore qualifying for debt relief. The landholding range is used to focus the analysis on only those farmers just above and below the cut-off for 100% relief. In all, there are 5,554 farmers within the sample frame.6\\n\\nThe analysis relies upon data from three sources. The first is the banks themselves. As an anti-corruption transparency measure, banks were required to publicly post details about all qualifying debt relief beneficiaries. This included the name, landholding, village, loan category, date of original disbursal, overdue principal and interest as of December 31, 2007, and eligible relief amount. All of this was posted to the notice boards of participating bank branches, and several banks also posted the information on their websites.\\n\\nThe second source is a detailed household survey conducted in late 2009, roughly one and a half years after the implementation of the debt relief program.7 Of the 5,554 farming households in the sample frame, 2,897 were surveyed. In most cases, the borrower on record with the bank was interviewed, unless another household member was the financial decision-maker and true user of the loan.

Post-relief income is net income from the prior year, plus upper- and lower-bound relief valuations for each of several possible annuity periods. Logged overdue balance, interacted with the 100% waiver (treatment dummy), is the instrument for post-relief income in 2SLS estimation. Fixed effects include bank \\u00d7 district, interviewer, and month-of-survey. Other controls include gender, audit status, and a fixed-effect for being in Miti village, where there was a special 5-acre land redistribution. Weighted regressions re-weight banks by their pre-survey distributions. The sample is trimmed to the top and bottom 5% of observations with respect to income. (When trimming observations outside 1.5\\u00d7 the inter-quartile range, results only slightly attenuated and still significant p<0.05. When not trimming at all, results are attenuated a bit more but still p<0.10; Winsorized results are similar.) OLS coefficients for rows two and three range from 0.12 to 0.17 (p<0.01). The first-stage strength of the instrument declines from specification (1) onwards, as seen in the last row; confidence in exogeneity likewise declines from p=0.48 in specification (1) to p=0.03 in specification (10). Weakness and/or endogeneity of the instrument is of particular concern in specifications (4), (6), (8), and (10), though the pattern of results is otherwise strong and clear. Standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the bank \\u00d7 district level.\\n\\n* p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01\"\n",

We examined the en- vironmental claims of 15 products that advertised themselves as “carbon neutral”. What we uncovered was that none of these green claims held up to scrutiny. To paraphrase Belgian surrealist René Magritte, ceci n’est pas climatiquement neutre. While the underlying actions related to the products and the companies’ producing them varied dramatically, they all relied heavily on carbon credits used to offset emissions to achieve supposed carbon neutrality. However, offsetting emissions is a problematic practice that delivers little to no benefits to the climate, especially when done with low-quality carbon credits. Fortunately, the tide began to turn on carbon neutrality claims in Following a slew of research highlighting the deceptive or misleading nature of these practices, the EU set in motion a legislative proposal to outlaw carbon neutrality and similar claims.\n",

But why is this? One major cause is the elastic methodologies used by carbon crediting standards that project developers are able to exploit to inflate the impact of REDD+ forest conservation projects, a major CMW-commissioned study uncovered. Carried out by UC Berkeley’s Carbon Trading Project, the investigation found significant over-crediting across all quality factors studied: baselines for estimating the amount of avoided forest loss, the leakage of forest loss to areas outside the project’s scope, forest carbon accounting, durability, and social safeguards. Perhaps most dramatically, the study revealed that 1,400% separated the lowest and the highest baselines. This allowed project developers to apply standards so fluidly that only one in every 13 credits analysed represented a real emissions reduction. READ PDF\n",

Carbon markets are no exception, and that is why we need CMW.” BOXOUT: DELIA VILLAGRASA Chair of the board \"Carbon Market Watch’s work remains essential. For instance, CMW’s recent report demonstrating that the 2030 climate targets of over 50 top corporations are significantly off track to keep within the 1.5°C global heating limit showcases the need for the EU and other regions of the world to accelerate climate action. Carbon Markets, if done right, are one tool to advance on this goal, and CMW’s work to keep carbon markets effective and clean is key.\" BOXOUT: ULRIIKKA AARNIO Board member \"Carbon Market Watch continues to stand out as a driving force in ensuring the environmental integrity of the EU’s climate policies.

      "-\n",
      "-The Emissions Trading System is one of the most important policy instruments in the EU’s climate armory, yet public awareness of and interest in the EU ETS is low. Few non-specialists know what this instrument is, how it works, and how it affects people both directly and indirectly.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-In a bid to raise public awareness of the Emissions Trading System, both its strengths and its weaknesses, we, in collaboration with our partners in the Life ETX project, produced a series of Human Stories documentaries capturing the promising yet unfulfilled potential of the EU’s Emissions Trading System.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-#### Taking wing\n",
      "-\n",
      "-The stories featured, drawn from Greece, Portugal and Belgium, highlight how ETS revenue is used to fund climate and environmental action.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-One example, from Portugal, utilises ETS funds to help build bike infrastructure and promote cycling. Another project from Portugal is an animal sanctuary that helps teach birds to fly again. In addition, ETS funds are supporting a just transition for coal regions in Greece by training up youth and promoting renewable energy.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-The videos we produced also highlight many of the EU ETS’s failings and shortcomings. Foremost among these are the plethora of pollution permits handed out to heavy industry absolutely free of charge. These freebies deprive national treasuries of desperately needed funds to finance the clean energy transformation, bankroll innovation in decarbonisation, and safeguard a just transition that leaves nobody behind.\n",

      "-\n",
      "-On behalf of Belgium’s consumer watchdog ‘Test Aankoop/Test Achats’, Carbon Market Watch checked out the special climate deals on offer at Belgian supermarkets. We examined the environmental claims of 15 products that advertised themselves as “carbon neutral”. What we uncovered was that none of these green claims held up to scrutiny. To paraphrase Belgian surrealist René Magritte, ceci n’est pas climatiquement neutre.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-While the underlying actions related to the products and the companies’ producing them varied dramatically, they all relied heavily on carbon credits used to offset emissions to achieve supposed carbon neutrality. However, offsetting emissions is a problematic practice that delivers little to no benefits to the climate, especially when done with low-quality carbon credits.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Fortunately, the tide began to turn on carbon neutrality claims in 2023. Following a slew of research highlighting the deceptive or misleading nature of these practices, the EU set in motion a legislative proposal to outlaw carbon neutrality and similar claims. Other governments are also exploring the issue. In addition, the courts and advertising standards authorities served up several landmark rulings against this kind of greenwashing.\n",

      "-\n",
      "-No sooner had we stopped campaigning for robust and ambitious 2030 climate targets, then we turned our attention to the next decade. In anticipation of the release of the European Commission’s proposed 2040 climate targets in 2024, we released a vision document advocating the achievement of net zero emissions in the EU a full decade earlier than the current 2050 deadline. This is both achievable and desirable.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Titled ‘2040: the homestretch’, our blueprint also outlined the role of the EU ETS and carbon removals in the 2030s.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Towards that end, we campaigned for the EU to set distinct and science-based 2040 climate targets that clearly separate between emissions reductions, carbon sequestration in the land sector and permanent removals. To demonstrate the groundswell of support for this position, we managed to get over 100 signatories to our open letter advocating the key principle that emissions reductions are the most credible climate action. The letter was sent out in early January 2024.\n",

      "-\n",
      "-Although the Emissions Trading System has helped bring down total emissions in the EU, the bloc’s overall carbon footprint remains exceedingly high. To get to the bottom of who is responsible for these emissions, we did some sleuthing. The EU ETS is organised around individual industrial installations, which tells us very little about the ultimate provenance of this pollution.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-To crack this, we traced the ownership of these plants and attributed their emissions to their parent companies. Our groundbreaking investigation uncovered some surprising results. Foremost among them: just 30 companies (less than 1% of the total) spew out half of all the emissions covered by the EU ETS.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Many of the one percenters named and shamed in our report are prominent players in their sectors. The multinational energy company RWE is the biggest emitter in the EU, whilst ArcelorMittal, ThyssenKrupp and HeidelbergCement provide heavy industry’s presence in the top 10.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Moreover, perversely, around €47.6 billion were handed out in free allowances to those sectors – effectively a licence to pollute at no cost. These handouts went predominantly to the steel, cement and petrochemical sectors.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Polluting for free in a climate crisis is an outrage; the Emissions Aristocracy has had it easy for too long. It’s high time for governments to phase out free allowances. This would speed up the pace of decarbonisation and raise more revenue for the clean and just transition.\n",

      "+The Emissions Trading System is one of the most\n",
      "+important policy instruments in the EU’s climate\n",
      "+armory, yet public awareness of and interest in\n",
      "+the EU ETS is low. Few non-specialists know what\n",

      "+people both directly and indirectly.\n",
      "+\n",
      "+In a bid to raise public awareness of the Emissions Trading System, both its strengths and\n",

      "+The videos we produced also highlight many of\n",
      "+the EU ETS’s failings and shortcomings. Foremost\n",

      "+\n",
      "+While the underlying actions related to the products and the\n",
      "+companies’ producing them varied dramatically, they all relied\n",
      "+heavily on carbon credits used to offset emissions to achieve\n",
      "+supposed carbon neutrality. However, offsetting emissions is a\n",
      "+problematic practice that delivers little to no benefits to the climate, especially when done with low-quality carbon credits.\n",
      "+\n",
      "+Fortunately, the tide began to turn on carbon neutrality claims in\n",
      "+2023. Following a slew of research highlighting the deceptive or\n",
      "+misleading nature of these practices, the EU set in motion a legislative proposal to outlaw carbon neutrality and similar claims.\n",

      "-This paper uses a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of income on subjective well-being. Among a population of indebted farmers in rural India, the marginal effect of income on self-reported life satisfaction is found to be positive and significant. However, the source of income is also found to exert independent effects. In this case the source is debt relief, which features a positive marginal effect but also a countervailing negative effect, perhaps due to stigma. The net effect is positive only for those farmers who received sufficient relief to overcome the fixed negative effect of program participation.\n",

      "-## 1. Introduction\n",
      "-\n",
      "-The relationship between income and experienced well-being has been the subject of debate for millenia. It has featured in Aristotle’s reflections on ethics ([Aristotle, 1891](#)), in the first purported book of economics (the Indian *Arthashastra* of the fourth century B.C., as discussed in [Rich, 2010](#)), and in the discussions of philosophers, statesmen, and economists to the present day. While rhetoric and observed correlation have predominated in the discussion thus far, in this paper I take a different tack. By employing modern econometric techniques to exploit a natural experiment, I estimate the actual causal effect of income for a particular population of farmers in rural India.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-My analysis considers an agricultural debt relief program launched by India in 2008, the largest such program ever undertaken. 710 billion rupees (about $14.6 billion) worth of agricultural debt was formally waived and tens of millions of Indian farmers benefited.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Average relief amounted to over Rs.17,000, roughly half the annual consumption expenditure of the average rural household.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Two features of this program made it particularly well suited to analysis. First, for most beneficiaries qualification was based upon a sharp landholding cut-off. Farmers owning land below a certain threshold received 100% relief, while farmers above that threshold qualified for only 25% relief. This allows me to estimate the causal effect of 100% relief by treating it as a natural experiment and using the landholding cut-off in a regression discontinuity design. Second, the 25% relief was contingent upon repayment of the remaining 75% balance. Because a large majority of 25%-relief beneficiaries in fact repaid their remaining balances, this allows me to infer a lower-bound valuation for full relief in terms of present-value wealth. Otherwise, it might have been difficult to value relief, as the value to beneficiaries could have been substantially less than face value.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-The key outcomes I consider are self-reported happiness and life satisfaction – collectively known as subjective well-being (SWB) – measured roughly 18 months post-relief. I follow a growing number of economists in considering these SWB measures as broad indicators of experienced well-being (see, e.g., discussions and reviews in Frey and Stutzer, 2002; Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2006; Loewenstein and Ubel, 2008; Fleurbaey, 2009). While there has been a substantial body of empirical work on the income-SWB relationship (e.g., Easterlin, 1974; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008), it has tended to be correlational in nature. My use of micro data from a natural experiment allows for a more focused consideration of the causal relationship.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Estimation of the income-SWB relationship proceeds here in three steps: (1) estimating the causal effect of debt relief on happiness and life satisfaction; (2) deriving conservative upper and lower bounds for the value of that relief in terms of present-value wealth and then annual income; and (3) estimating the effect of income on SWB with an instrumental variables approach, using debt relief as an instrument for post-relief income.\n",

      "-Because the income-well-being relationship sits squarely at the crossroads of choice- and experience-based measures of welfare, it is situated within the broader debate over how to best assess welfare. In this context, Kőszegi and Rabin (2008) lay out the basic case against welfare inferences drawn exclusively from choice behavior. Their conclusion that “choice behavior alone can never reveal which situations make people better off, even with unlimited data and under the maintained hypothesis of 100% rational choice” rests heavily on the fact that individuals’ preferences are choice-set-dependent (also called menu-dependent). Along the same lines, an earlier and more thorough theoretical critique can be found in Sen (1977). Relaxing the assumption of rationality only strengthens the argument.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Kőszegi and Rabin suggest, however, that choice is in fact a sufficient basis for welfare inference under certain “ancillary assumptions” that are likely to hold in many contexts. The trick is figuring out when these assumptions do or do not hold. When necessary, they suggest complementing choice-based measures with alternative approaches to the measurement of well-being, such as the measurement of happiness. They take, in fact, happiness or well-being to be the ultimate aim of public policy (p. 1824), but this is by no means an uncontested notion. Sen (2009) and Nussbaum (2008), for example, level a variety of conceptual objections. Fleurbaey (2009), Stiglitz et al. (2009), Thinley (2007), and Diener and Seligman (2004) discuss the issue from the perspective of replacing or complementing GDP as an indicator of social welfare or economic progress. Broader reviews of the “happiness economics” literature include Frey and Stutzer (2002), Di Tella and MacCulloch (2006), and Graham (2005).\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Though much work has focused on happiness, the related psychological literature on subjective well-being (SWB) has long posited two distinct dimensions (e.g., Diener, 1984; Diener et al., 1999). One dimension, most closely associated with self-report measures of happiness, is primarily hedonic in nature; it is variously associated with “positive affect” or “emotional well-being.” Another, most closely associated with self-report measures of life satisfaction, is more cognitive in nature; it is variously associated with “judgment” or “evaluation.” In this paper I call these dimensions, simply, happiness and life satisfaction.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-The relationship between income and SWB has been of particular interest within the economics literature. Most modern inquiry into the subject responds to or follows from Easterlin (1974). Easterlin suggested that richer countries were no happier than poorer countries, even though richer individuals were happier than poorer ones within any given country. This stylized fact has come to be known as “the Easterlin paradox” (but not without challenge, as in Veenhoven and Hagerty, 2006; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008). The United States has been an important case in point, where richer individuals have tended to report being happier than poorer ones, but tremendous post-war growth in per-capita income has not been matched by a corresponding rise in average happiness.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-There is a vast and growing body of empirical work on the subject. Most scholars follow Easterlin in considering cross-section or panel data, as in Di Tella and MacCulloch (2008), Layard et al. (2008), Hagerty and Veenhoven (2003), and Stutzer (2004). These studies tend to establish correlation, however, rather than causation. After all, one can tell many plausible stories for why both income level and income growth would be endogenous. Some, though, have come considerably closer to causal estimates. For example, Gardner and Oswald (2007) use longitudinal data for UK lottery winners to establish a positive income-SWB relationship.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) re-evaluate the Easterlin paradox by considering a wide range of data and methods. They present a variety of evidence against Easterlin’s findings, summarizing the income-SWB relationship with a single meta-estimate of 0.4. They present their estimate as broadly consistent across both within- and across-country analyses, find no evidence of a “satiation point” beyond which SWB no longer rises with income, and suggest that the relationship is similar for both happiness and life satisfaction (once these measures are standardized to a common scale). This pits their findings against a host of earlier studies, a fact that they confront in their discussion. The latest analysis by Kahneman and Deaton (2010), for example, finds important differences between happiness and satisfaction measures: the former feature satiation at a certain income level, while the latter do not.\n",

      "-India’s 2008 Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief program was partly motivated by a highly visible increase in farmer suicides, most notably in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, where high indebtedness among farmers was an oft-cited factor. The economic theory of *debt overhang* (Ghosh et al., 2000) may have also provided motivation, with the expectation being that lower indebtedness would increase the efficiency of investment across the agricultural sector. As a sizable transfer to over 36 million farmers before national elections, the program may have also served other political purposes. Because it reimbursed banks and cooperatives for bad loans, the program was also popular with these lenders, and may have helped to revive financially troubled institutions.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-The program considered formal agricultural debt issued by cooperative, commercial, and rural banks. This included crop loans, investment credits for direct agricultural purposes, investment credits for purposes allied to agriculture (e.g., dairy), and agricultural debt restructured under prior debt restructuring programs. Debt to moneylenders, relatives, and other informal lenders, as well as any loans taken for non-agricultural purposes, was not included in the program.\n",
      "-\n",
      "-To qualify for relief, a loan had to be overdue or restructured as of December 31, 2007 (well prior to the program announcement).

      "-*Dependent variable is self-reported life satisfaction, standardized. Post-relief income is net income from the prior year, plus upper- and lower-bound relief valuations for each of several possible annuity periods. Logged overdue balance, interacted with the 100% waiver (treatment dummy), is the instrument for post-relief income in 2SLS estimation. Fixed effects include bank × district, interviewer, and month-of-survey. Other controls include gender, audit status, and a fixed-effect for being in Miti village, where there was a special 5-acre land redistribution. Weighted regressions re-weight banks by their pre-survey distributions. The sample is trimmed to the top and bottom 5% of observations with respect to income. (When trimming observations outside 1.5× the inter-quartile range, results only slightly attenuated and still significant p<0.05. When not trimming at all, results are attenuated a bit more but still p<0.10; Winsorized results are similar.) OLS coefficients for rows two and three range from 0.12 to 0.17 (p<0.01). The first-stage strength of the instrument declines from specification (1) onwards, as seen in the last row; confidence in exogeneity likewise declines from p=0.48 in specification (1) to p=0.03 in specification (10). Weakness and/or endogeneity of the instrument is of particular concern in specifications (4), (6), (8), and (10), though the pattern of results is otherwise strong and clear.
