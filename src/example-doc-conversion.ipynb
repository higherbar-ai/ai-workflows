    "# About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple example of how to use the `ai-workflows` package to convert documents to Markdown format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires different settings depending on which AI service providers you want to use. If you're running in Google Colab, you configure these settings as \"secrets\"; just click the key icon in the left sidebar (and, once you create a secret, be sure to click the toggle to give the notebook access to the secret). If you're running this notebook in a different environment, you can set these settings in a `.env` file; the first time you run, it will write out a template `.env` file for you to fill in and direct you to its location. Following are the settings, regardless of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have an API key for an AI provider yet, [see here to learn what that is and how to get one](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/those-genai-api-keys-christopher-robert-l5rie/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI (direct)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `openai_api_key` - your OpenAI API key (get one from [the OpenAI API key page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and be sure to fund your platform account with at least $5 to allow GPT-4o model access)\n",
    "* `openai_model` (optional) - the model to use (defaults to `gpt-4o`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI (via Microsoft Azure)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI via Microsoft Azure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `azure_api_key` - your Azure API key\n",
    "* `azure_api_base` - the base URL for the Azure API\n",
    "* `azure_api_engine` - the engine to use (a.k.a. the \"deployment\")\n",
    "* `azure_api_version` - the API version to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anthropic (direct)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Anthropic directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `anthropic_api_key` - your Anthropic API key\n",
    "* `anthropic_model` - the model to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith (for tracing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can add [LangSmith tracing](https://langchain.com/langsmith):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `langsmith_api_key` - your LangSmith API key\n",

    "## Setting up the runtime environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This next code block installs all necessary Python and system packages into the current environment.\n",
