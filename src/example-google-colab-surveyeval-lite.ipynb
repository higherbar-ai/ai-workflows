    "# About this surveyeval-lite notebook (Google Colab version)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple example of an automated AI workflow. It's a much-simplified version of [the surveyeval toolkit available here in GitHub](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/survey-eval) designed to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This version, self-contained in this single notebook, uses [the ai-workflows package](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/ai-workflows), along with an OpenAI LLM, to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse a survey file into a series of questions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loop through each question to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Evaluate the question for potential phrasing issues\n",
    "    2. Evaluate the question for potential bias issues\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assemble and output all findings and recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the ai-workflows GitHub repo](https://github.com/higherbar-ai/ai-workflows) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses secrets, which you can configure by clicking on the key icon in Google Colab's left sidebar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenAI directly, configure the `openai_api_key` secret to contain your API key. (Get a key from [the OpenAI API key page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and be sure to fund your platform account with at least $5 to allow GPT-4o model access.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use OpenAI via Microsoft Azure by configuring the following secrets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `azure_api_key`\n",
    "2. `azure_api_base`\n",
    "3. `azure_api_engine`\n",
    "4. `azure_api_version`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can override the default model of `gpt-4o` by setting the `openai_model` secret to your preferred model, and you can optionally add [LangSmith tracing](https://langchain.com/langsmith) by setting the `langsmith_api_key` secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your survey file\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will prompt you to upload a survey file. It will then parse that file into a series of questions and evaluate each question for phrasing and bias issues. The simpler the file's formatting, the better the results will be."
